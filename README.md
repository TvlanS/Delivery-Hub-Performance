# Sorting-Hub-Performance

### Sort Hub Productivity

Evaluate the productivity of company Z's sorting hubs, specifically focusing on the performance of sort hubs in the Malaysia region.  
A query is to be writen to calculate the total number of parcels processed at each sort hub in East Malaysia daily, categorized by parcel size, for the period from 1th Dec 2024 to 25th Dec 2024.

**Requirements:** 
- **Datetime format:** All datetime values are in UTC. Convert them to local time by adding 8 hours and display the results accordingly.  
- **Parcel size mapping:** The `orders.parcel_size_id` column determines the parcel size. Replace the `parcel_size_id` values with descriptive labels as follows:

| Parcel Size ID | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| 0              | XXSMALL     |
|----------------|-------------|   
| 1              | XSMALL      |
|----------------|-------------|
| 2              | MEDIUM      |
|----------------|-------------|
| 3              | LARGE       |
|----------------|-------------|
| 4              | XLARGE      |
|----------------|-------------|
| 5              | JUMBO       |


- **Rules:**  
  - If a parcel is scanned multiple times in one day, count it as a single parcel.  
  - If a parcel is scanned over several days, count it once for each day.  
  - If a parcel is scanned at different sort hubs, count it once per sort hub.  
  - Exclude any records related to test shippers, test hubs, or tracking IDs containing the words "test" or "testing."  
  - Arrange the output by sort hub name, date, and parcel size.

### Required Output Columns:
| Date       | Sort Hub Name     | Parcel Size   | Total Parcels   |  
|------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|  
| ...        | ...               | ...           | ...             |
